        The advent of the "information age", as theorized by science fiction, has
        promised to transform the world into something completely new, guided by
        technological and transhumanist principles. As we move into the future,
        aka the 21st century, we find our culture continually suprised by how
        new inventions both resemble yet subvert science fiction. We do not have
        hoverboards, but we have social media networks that allow individuals to
        exist and transform themselves in an entirely digital realm. Old definitions
        of what constitutes "reality", the physical bedrock upon which we stand,
        grows thinner and thinner as more and more of life is lived outside
        our physical body and inside the internet.
        <br><br>
        New Genesis Artform is a creative project aimed at exploring how the digital
        world may be used for spiritual action by inverting and augmenting
        status-quo means of living.
