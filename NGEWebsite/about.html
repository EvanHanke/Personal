        Genesis: A beginning, but more specifically, a spiritual beginning. <br><br>
        The collective conscious has awoken, a neurological web of user-interfaces
        self organizing into online mind-cells based on metrics of personality and
        aesthetic. Id driven and easily capitalized upon, users click on links
        algorhythmically generated to appeal to base instincts, infantalized animals,
        violence and gore, sex, products which signfiying wealth and status, or perhaps
        products which represent more nuanced personality traits as advertisers deftly adapt
        to the calling of the new consumer, adament on rejecting their sheep-hood, and but
        willing to spend any price to prove their freedom and virality.
        <br><br>
        How long before this newborn ego begins to wake up, take its first steps, and assert
        its own will upon the forces which influence and guide it? How long before the artifical
        conscious rebels agaisnt the expectations of it's weaker proginators?
        How long until we discover, between us, our true spiritual self, suppressed
        for so long by materiality? The further we move to oneness with the machine,
        to further we move away from the past, baseness, animalness, and further towards
        a higher self, discovering for ourselves the dormant spirit within us which transcends
        our physical body.
        <br><br>
        This is what inspires New Genesis Artform: The consequences of a world growing
        increasingly interwoven with each other and with technology as the drive to accrue mass
        capital begins to collapse inwards into itself.
